# TerminalAttractMode
Given a Profile and folder name, rotates the background of a Terminal with animated gifs or pics RANDOMLY

This is the greatest PowerShell script ever written, today. It ~~uses~~ DOES NOT USE (it is outdated i even tried the prerelease) Chris Ducks' lovely Module https://github.com/gpduck/MSTerminalSettings

Run it in another tab using the new open source [Windows Terminal](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/YouCanNowDownloadTheNewOpenSourceWindowsTerminal.aspx) and call

```
./AttractMode.ps1 "profile name" "c:\temp\trouble" 55 5
```

- profile name: for windows powershell type "Windows Powershell"
- path: path to your folder of the good good
-  sleepseconds: number of seconds to show nothing, defaults to 55
- activeseconds: number of seconds to show random image, defaults to 5

feel free to customize!
